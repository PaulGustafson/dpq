* Todo list

** polishing, documenting and testing. 

** DONE Unifying the existential pair and tensor pair.

** DONE Implement a lazy circuit generation.
   This is implemented in the lazy-circuits branch. 
   Base on the testing results, it run much slower than the
   closure3 branch. I think this is pretty much useless because
   we are really implementing a cbv language.

** DONE Change the syntax to forall (x :: T) -> T and \ x -> t. 

** DONE Handle the evaluation memory usage.
   This is implemented in the closure3 branch. It cannot run 
   supper large circuit, i.e., > 1,000,000 gates. But I implemented
   a simple reference count GC, so naive looping will not leak memory.

** TODO Implement Agda style '?'. 

** TODO Eliminate existsBox.
